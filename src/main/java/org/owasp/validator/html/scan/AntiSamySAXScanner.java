 * Writer writer) API so the HTML input and output doesn't all have to be held in memory at the same
 * time. It should not be called directly. All scanning should be done through an <code>
 * AntiSamy.scan()</code> method invocation. The HTML sanitization logic built into
 * AntiSamyDOMScanner is leveraged by this class as well.
